============

Learn how to use the jshint code quality/consistency tool.

# What?

If you have writen JavaScript code professionally you will have come accross 
[The Good Parts](http://javascript.crockford.com/) by Douglas Crockford.

To *encourage* people to *only* use the predictable & well behaved ("good")
parts of JS, [Crockford](https://github.com/douglascrockford) developed 
[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) 

*However* ... many developers find Crockford's JSLint to be 
***too restrictive*** and ***opinionated*** 


If you're completely new to JSHint read: http://jshint.com/about/

## Why?

1. To make your own code consistently awesome.
2. Ensure that *everyone* on your team writes similar (*maintainable*) code
3. See *immediately* if code (quality) gets worse (and *remedy* it!)

## How?

### jshint.com

You *can* simply paste your code into the input area on http://jshint.com/
But that gets tedious after a few goes. You need a more robust (and
*automatic*) way of checking your code e.g. every time you save.

### Sublime Text Plugin

Once you have [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) *installed*.

Install **Package Control** (if you don't already have it)
https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2
[ follow their installation instructions ]
