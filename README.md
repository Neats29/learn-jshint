============

Learn how to use the jshint code quality/consistency tool.

# What?

If you have writen JavaScript code professionally you will have come accross 
[The Good Parts](http://javascript.crockford.com/) by Douglas Crockford.

To *encourage* people to *only* use the predictable & well behaved ("good")
parts of JS, [Crockford](https://github.com/douglascrockford) developed 
[JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) 

*However* ... many developers find Crockford's JSLint to be 
***too restrictive*** and ***opinionated***
